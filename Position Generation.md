A position generation system is a tool that is given a topic, and generates multiple stances on it. This can be useful for things like helping a debater practice responding to conflicting points, helping someone learn about an issue by showing multiple perspectives in [[arguments]], or helping teachers spark discussions in the classroom to show how complex a topic might be. The goal is to show that most topics aren't simply just black and white, and that there are many different perspectives that can emerge from a seemingly simple topic. Similar ideas have been explored in research on computer assisted argumentation methods [1].

IBM has their own AI system called the Project Debater. This system can engage in a live human [[Debate]] by scanning large text databases and builds persuasive [[arguments]] on nearly any topic. This tool demonstrates how AI can contribute to discussions and learning by generating stances that use evidence based reasoning and logic [2].
