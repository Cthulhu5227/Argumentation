In our framework, a position generation system is a system that is given a topic, and generates multiple stances it. This can be useful for things like helping a debater practice responding to conflicting points, helping someone learn about an issue by showing multiple perspectives on an argument, or helping teachers spark discussions in the classroom to show how complex a topic might be. The goal is to show that most topics aren't simply just black and white, and that there are many different perspectives that can emerge from a seemingly simple topic. Similar ideas have been explored in research on computer assisted argumentation methods [1].

IBM has their own AI system called the Project Debater. This system engages in live human debates by scanning large text databases and builds persuasive arguments on nearly any topic. This tool demonstrates how AI can contribute to discussions and learning by generating stances that use evidence based reasoning and logic [2].
