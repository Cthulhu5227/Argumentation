In argumentation, weak spot analysis focuses on finding the points in a line of reasoning that are most vulnerable, including questionable premises, gaps in logic, or insufficient evidence. This is a method of testing an [[Arguments|argument]] to reveal where misunderstandings or biases may have had an influence. This approach builds on ideas from computational argumentation, using models that identify weak premises or generate counterarguments by targeting those vulnerable points [1]. 

From a cognitive augmentation perspective, weak spot analysis works to help in improving ways of thinking. These systems guide users to reflect on the individual aspects of their arguments which lead to a stronger argument overall. Research on AI-based augmentation suggests that these tools can help lead to improved focus, memory, and ability to detect inconsistencies [2].
