Statistical Interpretation are systems that help people understand the context and meanings behind statistical information. These tools address a major limitation of the human mind, the difficulty many people have in accurately interpreting statistics and probability.  There are several tools that can help communicate your argument more effectively when it relies on statistics or probability.

One common method is through Graphing. Visual representations such as charts or digital graphs make complex data easier to interpret and help [[Arguments]] be communicated more clearly. Graphing is both fast and flexible, allowing users to modify visuals quickly while making key relationships more apparent.  Furthermore, It can help with interpretation of graphs and statistics to help make [[Implicit]] arguments more visible and persuasive.

Another approach to addressing this cognitive limitation is the use of statistical interpretation systems themselves. These systems guide users in analyzing data and drawing logical conclusions, ultimately improving the clarity and strength of their [[Arguments]] and enhancing overall understanding.

Graphs are an effective way to present data and strengthen an [[Arguments|argument]].  They display information in a clear and accessible form, especially when the data is too extensive to interpret individually. A well designed graph can convey the meaning of an entire paragraph through a single visual [1].  Below, there are some examples of graphs commonly used to make an [[Arguments|argument]]. Creating graphs can help you make your [[Arguments]] more digestible and understandable for your audience, whether that audience is an opponent or a neutral observer. Digital media can help with the creation and modification of these tools. Programs such as Excel[2], Desmos[3], R[4] and others are commonly used for this purpose.

Computers and humans can both assist in interpreting data, which is valuable for [[argumentation]] as it helps generate premises and support [[Conclusions]]. They can draw [[Conclusions]] and communicate those clearly in a debate or everyday discussion.  This job can be done by people or AI (AI meaning a host of machine learning programs). Each can perform different data analysis on a data set. Humans tend to "rule in" the context of the data and are much better at communicating their findings more clearly. AI tools can draw [[Conclusions]] from larger statistical methods, however, their findings can be harder too understand or make movement on[6]. Overall, combining human reasoning with computational analysis enhances data interpretation and can significantly augment [[argumentation]].
