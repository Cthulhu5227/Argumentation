Persuasion helpers are systems and tools that help users create and analyze persuasive communication. They augment cognition by providing feedback on clarity, tone, and argument structure, which helps users refine their reasoning and express ideas more effectively. AI-powered writing assistants can enhance cognitive performance by taking over linguistic and [[Rhetoric|rhetorical]] tasks, allowing users to focus more deeply on critical thinking and message intent [1].

Writing assistants such as Grammarly or ChatGPT are common examples of persuasion helpers. These tools can analyze sentence flow, suggest persuasive phrasing, and even generate [[Arguments|counterarguments]] to improve reasoning. By offloading the more tedious parts of writing and editing, they give people room to think more critically about their ideas, turning persuasion into a more thoughtful and intentional process [2].

However, persuasive technologies need to be developed with care. While they can improve reasoning and communication, they also have the potential to mislead or bias users if not used responsibly [3]. Designing them with clear ethical limits helps ensure that persuasion helpers strengthen thinking rather than quietly manipulate it.
