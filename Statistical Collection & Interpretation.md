Graphing using online or digital media allows for arguments to be better communicated. It is fast and effective, and allows for quick changes to one's graph.  Furthermore, It can help with interpretation of graphs and statistics to help make [[implicit]] arguments. 

Graphs are an effective way to present data to make an [[arguments|argument]].  They display the data in a relational or consumable fashion when data is too numerous to digest individually.  They can be used to convey a paragraph of meaning with a simple picture [1].  Making graphs can help you make your arguments more digestible and understandable for your audience, wither that be your opponent or a 3rd party. Digital media ca help with the creation and modification of these tools. Programs such as Excel, desmos, R and others are commonly used for this purpose. Graphs are an effective tool in argumentation.

Computers and people can also help us interpret data. This can be helpful to argumentation as a way to create premises/support conclusions. They can draw conclusions and communicate those clearly in a debate or normal setting.  This job can be done by people and ai. Each can perfom different data analysis on the data set. humans tend to rule in the context of the data and are much better at communicating their findings more clearly. Ai tools can draw conclusions from larger statistical methods but can be harder too understand or make movement on. Data interpretation can be used to augment argumentation.
