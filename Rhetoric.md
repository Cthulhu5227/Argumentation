Rhetoric is the art of using language to persuade. Rhetoric is divided into three main categories, as described by Aristotle [1]. These categories are: ethos, pathos, and logos. The first rhetorical strategy, _ethos_, appeals to credibility. For example, citing information from someone with a PhD in the subject builds trust with the audience. The second strategy, _pathos_, appeals to emotion, like how describing a struggling student’s situation can make the audience feel empathetic towards them. The final strategy, _logos_, appeals to logic and reasoning. An example of this would be using clear statistics or evidence to support a claim. Using these three strategies together in [[Argumentation]] can influence how an audience understands, believes, and responds to your message.

A system that demonstrates how rhetorical strategies can be implemented is the [[Online Debate Platforms]] Kialo [2]. Kialo presents arguments and counterarguments in a tree format to help users assess the credibility of sources, emotional framing, and logical support. This ensures that [[Arguments]] appeal to all three of the major rhetorical strategies.
